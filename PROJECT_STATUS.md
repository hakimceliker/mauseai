# MouseAI — Project Status

**Repository:** `hakimceliker/mauseai`  
**Default branch:** `main`  
**Status owner:** GPT/Codex (code, CI, technical evidence)  
**Last verified:** 2026-10-01

## Status vocabulary

- **DONE:** implemented and merged into `main`, with required CI evidence.
- **VERIFIED:** runtime or production behavior was executed and evidence is recorded.
- **PARTIAL:** some implementation or evidence exists, but an acceptance gate remains.
- **BLOCKED:** safe progress requires an external credential, account action, or human decision.
- **PRODUCTION-READY:** only when code, CI, deployment, live auth/tenant isolation, workflow, observability, and rollback evidence are all verified.

## Current decision

**Overall:** `PARTIAL — NOT PRODUCTION-READY`

Code and CI gates are healthy. Production acceptance is intentionally withheld until live Auth/RLS tenant isolation and Inngest workflow evidence are recorded with non-secret test credentials. Missing credentials are reported as `credential_not_configured`; no secret value is stored here.

## Evidence baseline

| Area | Status | Evidence | Remaining gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| Governance and phase plan | DONE | [Canonical phase plan](docs/mouseai-master-phase-plan-v1.0.md), PR [#83](https://github.com/hakimceliker/mauseai/pull/83) | Keep status current |
| Code/quality gates | DONE | PR [#84](https://github.com/hakimceliker/mauseai/pull/84), main commit `6e950b4` | None for this gate |
| Production health/readiness | VERIFIED | [Production smoke runbook](docs/production-smoke-runbook.md) | Refresh after releases |
| Supabase profile-to-tenant mapping | VERIFIED | [Auth/Tenant runbook](docs/governance/st36/plan-004-auth-tenant-runbook.md) | Live login and negative RLS test |
| Auth and tenant isolation | PARTIAL | Smoke runner returns `credential_not_configured` when tokens are absent | Run with approved test accounts |
| Inngest worker/checkpoint/audit | PARTIAL | [Inngest acceptance runbook](docs/governance/st36/plan-005-inngest-acceptance-runbook.md) | Trigger a real production workflow |
| AI providers | PARTIAL | Provider/cost runbook | Runtime provider proof without exposing keys |
| Payments | PARTIAL | Stripe sandbox only | User/payment acceptance decision |
| Observability | PARTIAL | Sentry/Langfuse/PostHog plans | Live event/trace proof |

## Single next step

Run the production acceptance checklist with approved test accounts and workflow identifiers. Do not mark production-ready from health endpoints alone.

## Ownership

| Owner | Scope | Deliverable |
|---|---|---|
| GPT/Codex | Code, migrations, API, tests, CI, technical docs | Branch, PR, CI evidence, rollback note |
| Claude/Reviewer | Review, security, architecture consistency | Review findings and decision |
| User | Secrets, account/payment/legal approvals | Configure credentials and approve external actions |
| Supabase | Auth, database, RLS, storage | Live tenant/RLS evidence |
| Vercel | Production deployment and env management | Deployment and env verification |
| Inngest | Durable execution, retry, checkpoint | Workflow run evidence |

## Change-control rule

Every change must update this file or a linked evidence file, identify the branch/PR/commit, and state whether the result is DONE, VERIFIED, PARTIAL, BLOCKED, or PRODUCTION-READY.
